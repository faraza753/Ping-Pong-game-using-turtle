“Turtle” is a python feature like a drawing board, which lets you command a turtle to draw all over it! You can use functions like turtle. forward(...) and turtle. left(...) which can move the turtle around.
In this project we will make a ping-pong game using turtle package in this we make 




•	A score board


•	2 Paddle at corner




•	One ball which moves in a loop




After that ,



 
     #pip  install turtle  

If above installation shows error the ignore it  

Important Point:- Don’t save your file with name turtle.py it otherwise system uses that file as package
