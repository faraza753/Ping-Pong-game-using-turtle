“Turtle” is a python feature like a drawing board, which lets you command a turtle to draw all over it! You can use functions like turtle. forward(...) and turtle. left(...) which can move the turtle around.


It is a two-player game based on table tennis. The game features simple 2D graphics. It consists of two paddles used to return a bouncing ball back and forth across the screen. The score is kept by the numbers at the top of the screen
